# my-summer-in-markdown
## Introduction
- My name is Ali
- I am a Sophomore at Chatsworth Charter High School
- I like to play video games
## Summer Activities
- I went hiking with my cousins often
- I went to the gym with my friends after summer school
## Favorite Movie
- I watched the new Deadpool movie and I really enjoyed it. It was definitely my favorite movie of the summer. I also watched a movie called Waves which was very sad
## Goals for the School Year
- I will get Straight A's for every class
- Focus on myself more
## Summer Playlist
- I listened to a TON of Tame Impala, Tyler the Creator, and Don Toliver. Don Toliver dropped what is arguably his best album so far, and I spent a lot time with it. Tyler the Creator's "Call Me If You Get Lost" album is perfect for the summer vibes
## Learning Experiences
- I took a semester of Spanish 2 over the summer, and I am really glad I did because I did not enjoy that class last year.
